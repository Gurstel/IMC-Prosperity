    "Here's a breakdown of how your profit from an expedition will be computed:\n",
    "Every spot has its **treasure multiplier** (up to 100) and the number of **hunters** (up to 8). The spot's total treasure is the product of the **base treasure** (7500, same for all spots) and the spot's specific treasure multiplier. However, the resulting amount is then divided by the sum of the hunters and the percentage of all the expeditions (from other players) that took place there. For example, if a field has 5 hunters, and 10% of all the expeditions (from all the other players) are also going there, the prize you get from that field will be divided by 15. After the division, **expedition costs** apply (if there are any), and profit is what remains.\n",
