okay these coupons makes no sense:

Our inhabitants are crazy about coconuts. So crazy even, that they invented a new tradable good, `COCONUT_COUPON`. The coupons will give you the right to buy `COCONUT` at a certain price by the end of the round and can be traded as a separate good. Of course you will have to pay a premium for these coupons, but if you play your coconuts right, SeaShells spoils will be waiting for you on the horizon.

Coconut Coupons give the right to buy Coconut at a certain price at some time in future. Certain price = 10000 and some time in future = 250 trading days, each round is 1 trading day.

Position limits for the newly introduced products:

- `COCONUT`: 300
- `COCONUT_COUPON`: 600
